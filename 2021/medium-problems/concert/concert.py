"""Create a function that determines whether each seat can "see"
the front-stage. A number can "see" the front-stage if it is
strictly greater than the number before it.

Everyone can see the front-stage in the example below:

(TEST CASE)
# FRONT STAGE
[[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1],
[2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4],
[6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 5]]

# Starting from the left, the 6 > 5 > 2 > 1, so all numbers can see.
# 6 > 5 > 4 > 2 - so all numbers can see, etc.

Not everyone can see the front-stage in the example below:

(TEST CASE)
# FRONT STAGE
[[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1],
[2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2],
[5, 5, 5, 10, 4, 4],
[6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 5]]

# The 10 is directly in front of the 6 and blocking its view.
The function should return True if every number can see the front-stage, and False
if even a single number cannot.

(TEST CASES)
Examples
can_see_stage([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]) ➞ True

can_see_stage([
  [0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [2, 2, 2]
]) ➞ True

can_see_stage([
  [2, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [2, 2, 2]
]) ➞ False

can_see_stage([
  [1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [2, 2, 2]
]) ➞ False

Number must be strictly smaller than
the number directly behind it.

Create some test cases to check your code.
