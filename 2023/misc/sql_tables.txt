3 – Consider the following database schema:

TABLE     COLUMNS
--------  -------------------------------------
SUPPLIER  SUPPLIER_CODE, SUPPLIER_NAME, CITY
PART      CODE_PART, NAME_PART, PRICE
CAR       CODE_CAR, NAME_CAR, TYPE
SUPPLY    CODE_SUPPLIER, CODE_PIECE, CODE_CAR

Write an SQL command that is able to query the suppliers located in the city named
“VITORIA” that provide the part code “MOTOR” for the car coded “KOMBI”, with their
respective prices.

Example:
SUPPLIER    PRICE
----------  -----
Supplier A  1,000
Supplier B  1,500

-- I think that the PART.PRICE should be in the SUPPLY Table to be more consistent general requirements.
-- The price is a relationship among the three: supplier, piece(part), and car.
SELECT supplier_name,
       price
FROM SUPPLIER,
     PART,
     CAR AS c,
     SUPPLY AS s
WHERE city = "VITORIA"
  AND code_part = "MOTOR"
  AND c.code_car = "KOMBI"
  AND s.code_supplier = supplier_code
  AND s.code_piece = code_part
  AND s.code_car = c.code_car
