"""
Problem:
Check if two strings are anagram

Complexity to solve: 1 for seniors, maybe 5 for juniors (out of 10)
Juniors could think of counting the letters in a builtin dict,
or sorting without sorted function.

Which is better?
Time complexity and space complexity
1. Using sorted:
O(n.log(n)) (Quicksort O(n^2)), O(1)
2. Using Counter
